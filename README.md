# AchaPet

This project is a web application that was created to serve as a bridge between rescue organizations or individuals seeking to adopt pets or found lost or abandoned animals and are putting them up for adoption. It's also useful in case of someone that lost his pet and is trying to find it. They can do so by creating a "Lost Alert" on the platform, so if others find it, it's easy to make contact and return the animal to its owner. Alternatively, users can check already existing "Found Alerts" on the platform, where lost animals that were found can be registered. If the found alert is already registered, it's possible to either contact whoever found it on their phone or message them through the platform. Its main purpose is to facilitate communication and data sharing, maximizing the opportunities for pets to be adopted or found by centralizing the search, communication and all the necessary steps in only one spot.
